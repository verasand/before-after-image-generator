# "Before & After" Comparison Generator

This is a simple web project to create a side-by-side comparison image from two pictures uploaded by the user: a **"Before"** image and an **"After"** image.  
The application combines both images onto a single canvas and allows the user to download the final result.

## Project Structure

Since all the functionality (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is contained within a single file, the structure is very simple:

comparison-generator/
│
├── .git/
├── image-comparison-generator.html
└── README.md
